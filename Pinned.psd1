4.0.0
- Added HTTP/HTTPS installer download support via BITS (with Invoke-WebRequest fallback)
- Fixed version enforcement: Test-TargetResource now requires an exact version match
- Fixed Get-TargetResource InstalledCheckFilePath branch (undefined MsiProductID bug)
- Removed application-specific hardcoding; ForceVersion is now a generic registry write
- Fixed Get-SemanticVersion crash when version string has fewer than 4 components
- ForceVersion is now a boolean in both psm1 and schema.mof (was untyped/string)
- Added UseSemVer to schema.mof
- Unified temp file cleanup (UNC copies and HTTP downloads are both removed after install)
- Fixed exit code 1603 check (exact int comparison instead of -like string match)
